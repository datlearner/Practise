Create a Simple Class:

Define a class called Person with properties name and age. Create an instance of the class and log the properties.
Class Methods:

Add a method greet to the Person class that returns a greeting message using the name property. Create an instance and call the method.
Constructor Parameters:

Modify the Person class to accept name and age as parameters in the constructor. Create multiple instances with different values.
Class with a Method to Calculate Age:

Create a class Car with properties make, model, and year. Add a method age that calculates the car's age based on the current year.
Inheritance:

Create a base class Animal with properties name and species, and a method speak that logs a generic message. Create a subclass Dog that overrides the speak method to log a dog-specific message.
Static Methods:

Add a static method compareAge to the Person class that takes two instances of Person and returns the older person.
Encapsulation:

Modify the Car class to have a private property _mileage and a method to get and set the mileage value. Ensure the mileage cannot be set to a negative value.
Getters and Setters:

Create a class Rectangle with properties width and height. Add getter and setter methods for width and height that validate the input and calculate the area of the rectangle.
Class with a Collection:

Create a class Library with a property books (an array). Add methods to add a book, remove a book by title, and list all books.
Method Chaining:

Create a class Calculator with methods add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Each method should modify a property value and return this to allow method chaining.
These exercises will help you get comfortable with defining and using classes, working with constructors, methods, inheritance, and encapsulation in JavaScript.
